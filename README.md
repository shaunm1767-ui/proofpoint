## Overview
Explain your project briefly:

- **Purpose:** What problem this project solves  
- **Key functionality:** Main features or workflows  
- **Who should use it:** Target users or systems  

## Docker Setup
1. **Build the Docker image**
```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-app
docker ps
curl http://localhost:8080/health
rm README readme.txt "Read me text"

---

If you save this as **`README.md`** in your project root, all platforms will render it correctly.  

I can also **make a “ProofPoint-ready” version** with your exact Docker image name, ports, and app-specific commands so you can drop it in and forget about it. Want me to do that next?
