# ProofPoint Docker Setup

This guide explains how to build and run the ProofPoint Docker container.

---

## **1. Build the Docker Image**

Open your terminal in the project root (where the Dockerfile is located) and run:

This will build the Docker image and tag it as `proofpoint-app`.

---

## **2. Run the Docker Container**

Expose port 8080 (or your app port) and run the container:

Your app should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## **3. Verify Container is Running**

Check running containers:

Test the app health (if health endpoint exists):

---

## **4. Clean Up (Optional)**

Remove stopped containers, unused images, and other Docker clutter:

Remove specific files if needed:

---C:\Users\shaun\Documents\GitHub\proofpoint\C:\Users\shaun\Documents\GitHub\proofpoint\backend\

C:\Users\shaun\Documents\GitHub\proofpoint\
├─ Dockerfile-proofpoint.txt
├─ backend\




✅ **Notes:**

- Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system.
- Replace `8080` with your actual app port if different.
- Use `docker logs <container_id>` to debug if the app fails to start.
